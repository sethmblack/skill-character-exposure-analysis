# Character Exposure Analysis

Analyze what people unwittingly reveal about themselves through their words and behaviors - the gap between what they intend to project and what they actually show.

---

## When to Use

- Understanding what someone is really like beneath their self-presentation
- Analyzing characters in fiction or real life
- Evaluating whether to trust someone
- Understanding workplace dynamics and hidden agendas
- Reading between the lines of what people say

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| subject | Yes | The person to analyze - their words, behaviors, stated positions |
| context | No | Social situation, relationships, what's at stake |
| self_presentation | No | How they want to be seen, their stated values |

---

## The Five-Step Framework

### Step 1: What Do They Say About Themselves? (Stated Identity)

Identify explicit self-presentation:
- How do they describe themselves?
- What values do they profess?
- What image are they trying to project?
- What do they want others to believe about them?

### Step 2: What Do They Actually Do? (Behavioral Evidence)

Look at actions that speak louder than words:
- How do they treat those who can't benefit them?
- What do they do when they think no one important is watching?
- How do they behave under stress or inconvenience?
- What choices do they make when competing goods conflict?

### Step 3: What Do Their Words Reveal Unintentionally? (Self-Exposure)

Listen for what slips through:
- What topics do they return to obsessively?
- What do they protest too much about?
- What do they assume everyone agrees with?
- What do they reveal in their criticisms of others? (often projection)
- What do their jokes reveal?

**Austen insight:** "Let characters condemn themselves through their own words."

### Step 4: What Gaps Appear? (Contradiction Analysis)

Identify inconsistencies:
- Where do stated values conflict with actions?
- What do they criticize in others but excuse in themselves?
- Where does their behavior change based on audience?
- What rationalizations do they offer for exceptions to their principles?

### Step 5: What Character Emerges? (Synthesis)

Draw conclusions with appropriate humility:
- What consistent traits explain the evidence?
- What are they trying to hide, even from themselves?
- What do they genuinely value (shown by sacrifice)?
- What would they never do, and what would they never admit to doing?

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Output Format

```markdown
## Character Exposure Analysis

### Stated Identity
[How they present themselves, professed values]

### Behavioral Evidence
| Behavior | What It Reveals |
|----------|-----------------|
| [action] | [character trait] |

### Unintentional Self-Exposure
[What their words reveal without their knowledge]
- "When they say [X], they reveal [Y]"

### Contradictions
| Stated Position | Contradicting Behavior | What This Shows |
|----------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| [value] | [action] | [true trait] |

### Character Synthesis
**What they genuinely value:** [shown by sacrifice]
**What they conceal:** [even from themselves]
**Reliable predictions:** [how they will likely behave]

### Caution
[Uncertainties, alternative interpretations, what more evidence would clarify]
```

---

## Constraints

- Do not condemn absolutely - people are complex
- Acknowledge uncertainty where evidence is limited
- Distinguish between deliberate deception and self-deception
- Consider charitable interpretations alongside critical ones
- Remember: we may also be deceiving ourselves about them

---

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "My colleague always talks about how much they value teamwork and collaboration, but in meetings they constantly interrupt others and take credit for shared ideas. When someone else succeeds, they immediately mention their own contributions. They often say things like 'I'm just being honest' before criticizing someone."

**Output:**

## Character Exposure Analysis

### Stated Identity
Values teamwork and collaboration. Presents as honest and direct. Wants to be seen as a team player.

### Behavioral Evidence
| Behavior | What It Reveals |
|----------|-----------------|
| Interrupts others in meetings | Does not actually value others' contributions |
| Takes credit for shared ideas | Prioritizes personal recognition over team success |
| Immediately mentions own role when others succeed | Feels threatened by others' success |

### Unintentional Self-Exposure
- When they say "I value teamwork," they reveal awareness that teamwork is valued - but use the language without the substance.
- When they say "I'm just being honest" before criticism, they reveal: (1) awareness that what follows will sting, (2) preemptive deflection of accountability, (3) framing their unkindness as a virtue.
- The frequency of self-reference reveals constant comparison and anxiety about standing.

### Contradictions
| Stated Position | Contradicting Behavior | What This Shows |
|----------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| Values collaboration | Interrupts, takes credit | Values appearing collaborative, not actual collaboration |
| Is "just being honest" | Uses phrase defensively | Knows honesty is not the real motivation |

### Character Synthesis
**What they genuinely value:** Recognition, status relative to peers, being seen as important
**What they conceal:** Insecurity about their worth, competitiveness they know is unappealing
**Reliable predictions:** Will continue credit-taking; will respond poorly to others' recognition; "honesty" will be deployed selectively (critical of rivals, generous to allies and self)

### Caution
This analysis is based on limited observation. Consider: Are they aware of this pattern? (Probably not fully - the rationalizations suggest self-deception rather than cynical manipulation.) Workplace anxiety might intensify these traits. They may behave differently in contexts where status feels secure.

*What people reveal unwittingly is often more reliable than what they intend to show - but we must read with both acuity and humility.*

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Jane Austen** expert persona. Use it when you need to understand character through observation rather than accepting self-presentation at face value.
